Below is the metadata for the associated experimental data files. Data
from `tess_beetleparams.csv` was generated from a statistical model that
is explained in the code.

`tess_beetledata_final.csv`:

\- `count`: count number (counts were conducted every two weeks)

\- `temp`: temperature in degrees celcius

\- `flour`: resource quality (flour type): "G" (good; 80% whole wheat
flour + 20% rice flour), "M" (good; 60% whole wheat + 40% rice flour),
"B" (bad; 40% whole wheat flour + 60% rice flour)

\- `replicate`: the replicate population within each treatment (1, 2 or
3)

\- `live`: number of live adult beetles

\- `dead`: number of dead adult beetles

`body_size_final.csv`:

\- `temp`: temperature in degrees celcius

\- `flour`: resource quality (flour type): "G" (good; 80% whole wheat
flour + 20% rice flour), "M" (good; 60% whole wheat + 40% rice flour),
"B" (bad; 40% whole wheat flour + 60% rice flour)

\- `replicate`: the replicate population within each treatment (1, 2 or
3)

\- `beetle_ID`: the replicate beetle within each population (1-25 for
founder population, 1-20 for all other populations)

\- `weight`: dry weight in grams
